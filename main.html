    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in lots of different jobs. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
    <p>I’ve been a professional cook and a owner/operator of hospitality businesses and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>

   <h3>Education</h3>
   <p class="thrice">It’s often hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But when you’re in those tough, dark spots, try to find the motivation to hang in there.<br>
     I started out with self-studying code in 2018, soon afterward I started coding with Treehouse and earned a Front End Track in 2018.</p>

    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p class="thrice">Gold Coast has been my home for the last 5+ years. It's one of the most beautiful places in the Australia. It's famed for its long sandy beaches, surfing spots and elaborate system of inland canals and waterways. Known for being the city on the beach with truly epic theme parks, the Gold Coast and its surrounding area has plenty to see and do for the whole family. Being this close to the beautiful nature, beaches, and northen river country towns allows me to take a break from coding and enjoy the outdoors.</p>

    <img src="img.jpg/bike.jpg" alt="my ride" class="hobby">
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p class="thrice">My passion as of the last few months has become coding. Aside from coding, I'm equally excited by and love spending time outdoors enjoying the riding my beautiful bike where I live, watching movies with hubby, singing and travelling around. I have been to few countries already. I lived in England/ Scotland for 5 years. Been to natural beauty NewZealand 4 times, Dubai. Next holidays will be in Europe hopefully.</p>

  <h2>Portfolio</h2>
  <p>These projects were completed during the 12 Stages of the Front End Web Development Program. The Front End Web Development Program is meant to train students in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and this lets me practice and shows my mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web without the assistance of frameworks.</p>
